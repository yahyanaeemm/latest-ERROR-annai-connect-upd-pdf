The AI engineer successfully initiated and completed the foundational MVP for the educational admission management system. The trajectory began with a comprehensive product description outlining three user roles (Agent, Admission Coordinator, Admin) and core functionalities like student admissions, document management, incentive tracking, and data export. The AI prioritized building the core role-based authentication and basic dashboards. It used  to establish the initial React frontend and FastAPI backend, handling database connectivity and environment variable usage meticulously. A critical step involved creating an  script to populate the database with demo users and incentive rules, enabling immediate testing. The work culminated in a comprehensive test run by the , which validated key workflows: agent login, student submission, document upload (mocked), status updates (pending/verified/approved), and basic incentive calculation, alongside API testing for Excel and PDF exports. The process demonstrated a clear understanding of the project scope, technical constraints, and a focused approach to deliver an aha moment MVP.

The goal is to build a web application for an educational institution to streamline student admissions. It manages students via agents, tracks agent incentives, verifies uploaded documents, and allows data export. The system features three distinct roles:
1.  **Agent:** Logs in via unique ID, submits new student admission forms, uploads scanned documents (TC, ID Proofs, Marksheets in JPG/PDF), receives an auto-generated unique token per student, views submission status (Pending/Verified/Approved/Rejected), and tracks earned incentives.
2.  **Admission Coordinator:** Logs in, reviews submitted student records, views uploaded documents, approves/rejects admissions, adds e-signature (digital pad or image), and submits for incentive approval.
3.  **Admin:** Full dashboard access, views all admissions, generates Excel reports (filterable by date/agent/course/status), marks incentives as paid/unpaid, and exports token receipts in PDF.
Additional features include scanned document storage linked to token IDs, dynamic incentive calculation rules (e.g., ₹3000 for BSc), summary statistics dashboard, responsive design, and a UI using white, deep navy (#002147), and gold (#D4AF37) colors. The solution requires a full-stack application (React frontend, FastAPI backend), MongoDB database, working login, admin dashboard, APIs for data export, and local storage for documents.

**Key Files and Their Importance:**

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** This is the core of the backend application, responsible for defining API endpoints, handling business logic, and interacting with the database. It includes routes for user authentication, student admission forms, document uploads, status updates, and data export functionalities.
    -   **Changes Made:** Initial comprehensive rewrite to set up FastAPI, MongoDB connection, CORS handling, authentication routes, user models, student admission models, and incentive rule models. It now includes endpoints for user login, student submission, status updates, and placeholder logic for document handling and data exports. A minor fix was introduced by the testing agent to an  block.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** The main React component that structures the user interface. It handles routing for different pages (login, agent dashboard, coordinator dashboard, admin dashboard) and renders specific components based on the user's role.
    -   **Changes Made:** Initial comprehensive rewrite to establish the basic UI layout, navigation, login form, and placeholder dashboards for Agent, Coordinator, and Admin roles, adhering to the specified color palette and UI guidelines. It consumes the backend APIs via .
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Contains component-specific or global CSS rules, complementing Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes Made:** Initial rewrite to include custom styles or overrides necessary for the application's unique visual design, especially concerning the specified color scheme (, ) and responsive design principles.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Lists all Python dependencies required for the FastAPI backend.
    -   **Changes Made:** Updated to include , , , , , , , , and . These enable API, database, authentication, Excel, and PDF functionalities.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** A utility script to populate the MongoDB database with initial demo data, including predefined user accounts (Admin, Admission Coordinator, Agent) and incentive calculation rules for different courses. This facilitates immediate testing and demonstration.
    -   **Changes Made:** Created from scratch. It connects to MongoDB and inserts initial user credentials and a set of incentive rules (, , , ).

<pending_tasks>
-   Full implementation of e-signature (digital pad or image upload) for Admission Coordinator.
-   Detailed Admin dashboard with comprehensive summary statistics (Total Admissions, Active Agents, Incentives Paid).
-   Advanced filtering options for Excel report generation (filter by date, agent, course, status) in the UI.
-   Functionality for Admin to mark incentives as paid/unpaid.

<current_work>
The current state of the product is a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an educational admission management system. The core foundation has been established, including:
1.  **Role-Based Authentication:** A working login system is in place, supporting Admin, Admission Coordinator, and Agent roles. Demo user credentials have been initialized (, , ).
2.  **Student Admission Workflow:** Agents can submit new student admission forms, providing details like student name and course. A unique token number is auto-generated for each student.
3.  **Document Uploads:** The system is set up to handle document uploads, with testing indicating it uses local paths for now.
4.  **Status Tracking:** Submissions can transition through statuses (Pending, Verified, Approved).
5.  **Incentive Calculation:** Basic incentive calculation rules have been defined and initialized, based on course categories (e.g., BSc, BNYS). Agents can view their total incentives.
6.  **Backend APIs:** Essential CRUD endpoints are implemented for users, student admissions, and incentive rules. APIs for Excel and PDF data export are present and have been tested for functionality.
7.  **Basic UI:** A functional frontend with a simple, responsive UI adhering to the specified color scheme (white, deep navy, gold) has been built using React and Shadcn UI components.
The system has passed comprehensive testing by the , confirming the successful operation of agent login, form submission, token generation, mocked document upload, status changes, incentive calculation, and the existence of export APIs.

<optional_next_step>
Enhance the existing admission and agent incentive platform with the following functionalities and fixes:

✅ 1. E-Signature Functionality for Admission Coordinator
	•	Enable digital signature input using a signature pad (touch or mouse input).
	•	Provide an option to upload a signature image (.jpg/.png).
	•	The signature should be saved and attached to the verified admission record.

✅ 2. Visual Approval Indicator
	•	Once a coordinator clicks “Approved”, the corresponding admission card/status should change to green to indicate success.
	•	Use color-coding (green for approved, red for rejected, yellow for pending).

✅ 3. Fixes in Receipt Upload Functionality
	•	Resolve current glitches or errors during PDF/token receipt upload or generation.
	•	Ensure each admission submission generates a downloadable receipt linked to the token number.

✅ 4. Add More Course Options
	•	Expand the course list to include new courses (editable list).
	•	Each course should be mappable to a separate incentive amount.

✅ 5. Admin Incentive Management
	•	Allow Admin to manually update/fix incentive amounts for any course from the Admin panel.
     - allow admin to update or add new course list name
	•	Incentive rules should be editable dynamically (₹ amount per course).

✅ 6. Report Export Fixes
	•	Fix existing issues in exporting reports from the Admin dashboard (Excel and PDF formats).
	•	Ensure filters (by agent, course, date, status) are applied correctly.

✅ 7. OTP-Based New Login Creation
	•	When a new user (Agent or Coordinator) signs up, send a verification OTP to their email.
	•	Login should be activated only after OTP is successfully verified.
