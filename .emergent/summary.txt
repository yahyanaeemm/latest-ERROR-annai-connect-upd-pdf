The trajectory details the transition from an initial MVP application to a more refined system. The previous AI engineer primarily focused on stabilizing the UI post-regression, fixing critical dark theme/color scheme issues, implementing a simplified leaderboard, and adding robust admin features like PDF receipt generation and comprehensive user management. Crucially, a core business logic flaw preventing automatic agent incentive generation upon student approval was identified and resolved by adding missing incentive rules and a bulk-fix mechanism. The current work, undertaken by the present AI engineer, began with a user request to enhance the Coordinator Dashboard. This involved implementing a paginated and filterable student list, replacing the previously cluttered display. The engineer successfully designed and implemented new backend API endpoints for student dropdowns, specific student documents, and paginated student data with filtering. A significant routing conflict in FastAPI was encountered and resolved by carefully reordering the API endpoint declarations. The backend changes have been thoroughly tested and verified. The frontend Coordinator Dashboard has been entirely redesigned to integrate these new pagination and filtering capabilities, though its testing is the immediate next step.

<product_requirements>
The application streamlines student admissions, managing students, tracking agent incentives, verifying documents, and exporting data. It supports Agent (form submission, document upload, status, incentives), Admission Coordinator (review, approve/reject, e-signature, incentive approval), and Admin (dashboard, reports, incentive payment). Initial features included document storage, dynamic incentive rules, and a responsive UI with specific branding. Subsequent enhancements added a 3-tier approval system and automated backup. Recent focus areas included a Leaderboard Feature (weekly, monthly, custom filters, top 3 highlighting), UI/UX modernization, accurate incentive numbers in Excel reports, and admin PDF receipt generation. A critical bug fixed involved agent incentives not automatically generating upon student approval. The latest requirement focuses on the Coordinator Dashboard, specifically demanding a paginated student list with robust filter options to improve data accessibility, replacing the previous cluttered, scrolling list. It also requires the ability to view all student documents and download PDF receipts.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**

-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Core FastAPI application, handling API routes, business logic, and database interactions.
    -   **Changes Made:** Added new endpoints:  (for student names),  (to fetch uploaded documents for a student),  (to download PDF receipt), and  (for filtered, paginated student data). Crucially, the new endpoints (, , , ) were strategically reordered to be declared *before* the existing  path parameter endpoint to resolve routing conflicts.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Main React component for UI rendering, routing, and role-based access.
    -   **Changes Made:** The  component was completely redesigned to incorporate student pagination, filtering capabilities, and the ability to view documents and download PDF receipts for selected students, aligning with the new backend APIs.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Contains global CSS styles.
    -   **Changes Made:** Styles related to modern dark/light mode themes were removed, aligning with the user's preference for a consistent bright theme.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Lists Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes Made:** No new dependencies explicitly added in this trajectory, but existing ones confirmed.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Manages Node.js dependencies and scripts.
    -   **Changes Made:**  and  were added in previous iterations. No new changes observed in this trajectory.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance:** Logs user problem statements, testing data, and records agent communications and test results.
    -   **Changes Made:** Continuously updated to track new backend and frontend tasks, log testing steps, and document the resolution of the FastAPI routing conflict.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on enhancing the Coordinator Dashboard based on explicit user feedback. The user requested to replace the clumsy single, continuous list of students with a paginated view, allowing a fixed number of students per page and navigation across multiple pages. Additionally, robust filter options were requested to quickly access different sets of student data, along with the ability to view documents uploaded by a particular student and download PDF receipts.

To address this, the engineer performed the following:
1.  **Backend API Development:** New FastAPI endpoints were added to :
    *   : To fetch student names for a dropdown menu.
    *   : To retrieve a student's uploaded documents.
    *   : To generate and download a PDF receipt for a specific student.
    *   : A comprehensive endpoint supporting pagination (skip, limit) and various filter options (e.g., status, course, agent).
2.  **Routing Conflict Resolution:** A critical routing issue was identified where the new path-specific endpoints () were clashing with the existing path parameter endpoint (). This was resolved by reordering the endpoint declarations in , ensuring static paths are processed before path parameters.
3.  **Backend Testing:** All newly implemented backend APIs (dropdown, documents, receipt, and paginated student data with filters) were thoroughly tested using  and confirmed to be working correctly.
4.  **Frontend Redesign:** The  component in  was completely rewritten to integrate the new paginated student list, filter options, and functionalities for viewing documents and downloading receipts.

The backend infrastructure for these enhancements is now fully functional and tested. The frontend redesign is complete, but its functionality remains to be tested.
