The AI engineer's trajectory demonstrates a comprehensive journey from an MVP to a more robust application. It began with critical UI and status display fixes, followed by a significant backend refactor to unify PDF receipt generation, ensuring dual signatures, incentive display, and A5 invoice-style layouts. A major branding overhaul was successfully implemented, standardizing the UI with new logos and a Deep Blue/Bright Teal color scheme. Subsequently, a targeted database cleanup endpoint was developed to prepare for public launch by clearing student data while preserving courses. The most recent phase involved debugging critical frontend issues: a non-functional agent profile photo upload (fixed by correctly linking the button to the file input) and, more extensively, the coordinator's inability to view agent-uploaded documents. This latter issue evolved through several discoveries: initially, agents' upload fields were hidden, then a frontend URL construction error for downloads (missing  prefix), and finally, an authentication issue preventing direct browser viewing of image files, which was addressed by fetching content with authentication and rendering it via a Blob URL or inline modal. The trajectory concludes with all identified issues resolved and backend tests passing.

The application's initial development focused on critical UI enhancements, including fixing a  visibility bug and ensuring Approve Student status displayed prominently in green. A core requirement was to unify PDF receipt generation for both Admin and Coordinator roles into a single, consistent A5 invoice-style format. This unified PDF needed to support dual digital signatures, incorporate course incentive amounts, and generate unique receipt numbers, while resolving prior layout, alignment, and Rupee symbol display issues.

A significant UI branding update followed, requiring the replacement of the Annai Connect logo and a complete color scheme overhaul. This involved applying a consistent brand palette (Deep Blue: #1B5BA0, Bright Teal: #4ECDC4, Dark Blue: #164a87, Light Teal: #7FDBDB) across the login screen (gradient), header, buttons, form elements, and other interactive components, all without breaking existing functionality.

More recently, the user requested a database cleanup to prepare for a public launch, specifically clearing all admitted student-related data while preserving course information. Subsequent bug reports included agents being unable to upload profile photos due to a non-functional button, and coordinators being unable to view documents uploaded by agents when clicking the eye icon in the student details view, particularly for image files (PNG/JPEG).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


-   ****:
    -   *Summary of Importance*: This is the core React application component, handling routing, state management, API interactions, and rendering of key UI components like , , and .
    -   *Summary of Changes*:
        -   Initial UI fixes for  visibility and approved status display.
        -   Extensive UI branding updates: new login logo, header styling, and application of brand colors to various  components and form focus states.
        -   **Agent Profile Photo Upload Fix**: Corrected the agent profile section's photo upload by ensuring the Upload Photo button correctly triggers the hidden file input, resolving a non-functional button issue (lines 990-1010).
        -   **Document Upload UI Visibility**: Removed  from agent document upload inputs (lines 829-840) to make them visible and user-friendly. Added upload success feedback.
        -   **Document Download/View Fix**: Modified  function (lines 1539-1557) to correctly handle document retrieval. Initially fixed  prefix issue, then addressed image viewing authentication by fetching with  and creating a blob URL for inline display. Added an  component for displaying images within the same page to circumvent browser security issues (added around line 2090 and in  rendering). Updated button labels to View for images and Download for PDFs.

-   ****:
    -   *Summary of Importance*: Defines global and component-specific styles, including the application's color scheme and layout.
    -   *Summary of Changes*: Comprehensive UI branding overhaul: implementation of new brand colors (Deep Blue , Bright Teal , Dark Blue , Light Teal ), gradient backgrounds for login and header, and consistent styling for buttons, form focus states, badges, and loading spinners.

-   ****:
    -   *Summary of Importance*: The FastAPI backend, responsible for defining API routes, interacting with MongoDB, and handling file operations (PDF generation, document serving).
    -   *Summary of Changes*:
        -   **Unified PDF Generation**: Implemented  to centralize PDF logic, improving efficiency and consistency. Updated  and  to use this function, adding dual signatures, course incentives, unique receipt numbering, and A5 invoice-style formatting with correct Rupee symbol.
        -   **Student Data Cleanup Endpoint**: Added a new  endpoint to clear , , ,  collections, preserving  and user data.
        -   **Document Retrieval and Download**: The existing  was examined and confirmed to be functionally correct for listing documents. A new endpoint, , was added (around line 795) to specifically handle authenticated document downloads/views. This endpoint now serves files with  for PDFs and  for images (JPEG, PNG) based on file type.

-   ****:
    -   *Summary of Importance*: Serves as the primary log for problem statements, testing data, protocols, and communication between the AI engineer and sub-agents, providing a historical record of development and debugging efforts.
    -   *Summary of Changes*: Continuously updated to document successful backend and frontend tests for all features implemented, including PDF generation, UI branding, data cleanup, agent profile photo upload, and crucially, detailed findings and fixes for the coordinator's document viewing/downloading issues, including the agent upload UI and image viewing authentication.

<pending_tasks>
All explicit tasks described within the trajectory, including UI fixes, PDF unification, UI branding, student data cleanup, agent photo upload, agent document upload UI visibility, and coordinator document viewing/downloading for both PDFs and images, have been addressed and validated by backend tests by the end of the trajectory.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user-reported bug where documents uploaded by agents were unable to view by coordinator on clicking the eye icon, specifically for image files showing an error on view.

The investigation revealed several layers of issues:
1.  **Agent Upload UI:** Initially, agents' file upload inputs in  were  (lines 829-840), preventing easy document uploads. This was fixed by removing the  class and adding feedback.
2.  **Backend Document Serving URL:** The frontend's  function (lines 1539-1557 in ) was constructing URLs like . However, Kubernetes ingress rules require backend API routes to be prefixed with . This meant direct  routes were not reaching the backend service.
3.  **Authentication for Image Viewing:** Even after fixing the  prefix, direct  for image files resulted in an authentication error (CORS/403 Forbidden). This was because the new browser tab did not carry the necessary authorization headers.

The AI engineer's solution involved:
*   **Backend Changes ():**
    *   Added a new API endpoint  (around line 795) to serve documents. This endpoint dynamically sets  to  for PDFs and  for images (JPEG, PNG), allowing browsers to display images directly.
*   **Frontend Changes ():**
    *   Modified  (lines 1539-1557) to fetch image files using  with proper authentication headers.
    *   Upon successful fetch, a  URL is created and opened, ensuring authentication is handled.
    *   An  component was added to  (around line 2090 and in rendering) to display images within the application, providing a more robust fallback and avoiding popup blockers.
    *   Button labels were updated to View for images and Download for PDFs.

The backend was restarted, and successful tests confirmed the new API endpoint works and serves files correctly with appropriate headers. The trajectory concludes with backend validation of the image viewing fix passing, indicating the issues are resolved.
