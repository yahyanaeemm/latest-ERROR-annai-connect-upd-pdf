<analysis>
The trajectory details an AI engineer's work on an existing MVP application, moving through several phases of development and bug fixing. Initially, the AI addressed UI/status fixes, refactored PDF generation for consistency and dual signatures, implemented a significant branding overhaul, and developed a database cleanup endpoint. A recurring challenge involved debugging document viewing for coordinators, specifically for image files, which required fixes for hidden upload fields, incorrect API URL prefixes, and authentication for direct browser image display.

Subsequent work focused on enhancing the application. The AI debugged a static leaderboard, identifying that it displayed dynamic data but with zero values, leading to UI enhancements for clarity. Following this, it implemented role-based masking of incentive data on the leaderboard for agents. A major feature addition included coordinator notes for student approvals and a comprehensive agent badge management system with associated backend APIs and frontend UI. Finally, the AI tackled critical regressions: a re-occurrence of the document download issue (traced to an erroneous double  prefix in the frontend URL construction) and a visibility bug in the new badge assignment modal, along with a  library incompatibility in the backend causing login failures. The trajectory concludes with all identified issues resolved and backend functionality validated.

The application's core purpose is to streamline student admissions and agent management. Initial requirements included critical UI fixes like  visibility and Approve Student status display. A key feature was the unification of PDF receipt generation for Admin and Coordinator roles into a consistent A5 invoice-style format, including dual digital signatures, course incentives, and unique numbering, while resolving prior formatting issues.

A significant UI branding update was mandated, involving a new Annai Connect logo and a complete color scheme overhaul (Deep Blue: #1B5BA0, Bright Teal: #4ECDC4, Dark Blue: #164a87, Light Teal: #7FDBDB) applied across the login, header, buttons, and form elements.

Recent user requests focused on:
1.  **Database Cleanup**: Clearing admitted student-related data while preserving course information for public launch.
2.  **Agent Profile Photo Upload Fix**: Rectifying a non-functional upload button for agent profile photos.
3.  **Coordinator Document Viewing Fix**: Addressing the inability of coordinators to view agent-uploaded documents, particularly image files (PNG/JPEG), due to authentication issues and incorrect URL construction.
4.  **Leaderboard Enhancements**: Addressing a static leaderboard by clarifying dynamic data display and later implementing confidentiality by masking incentive amounts for agents.
5.  **New Coordinator Features**:
    *   **Notes on Student Approval**: Allowing coordinators to add notes during student admission approval.
    *   **Agent Badge System**: Enabling coordinators to assign performance-based badges (e.g., Super Agent, Star Agent) that reflect in agent profiles.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in debugging two critical issues reported by the user:
1.  **Document Viewing/Downloading for Images (JPEG/PNG) Not Working for Coordinators**: This was a re-occurrence of a previously fixed issue. The user explicitly stated it worked for PDFs but not images and provided a reference summary of the prior fix.
    *   **Diagnosis**: The AI discovered that the frontend's  function was constructing URLs like  instead of . This was because the backend was already returning  with the  prefix (e.g., ), and the frontend was mistakenly adding another  prefix via the  constant.
    *   **Fix**: Modified the  function in  to use  instead of , effectively removing the redundant  prefix from the frontend's side.
2.  ** Authentication Error**: Discovered from backend logs, this error () was causing authentication failures.
    *   **Diagnosis**: Identified as a version incompatibility between  and  libraries.
    *   **Fix**: Updated  to pin the  version to  to ensure compatibility. The backend service was then restarted.

Additionally, a 404 login error was observed but determined to be a symptom of the  URL construction issue, which was resolved by the document viewing fix. The agent had also previously addressed the visibility issues with the new agent badge assignment modal, changing its transparent theme to a solid white popup with improved styling and contrast, which was verified via screenshot. The login flow was also re-tested and confirmed to be working correctly after the bcrypt fix.
