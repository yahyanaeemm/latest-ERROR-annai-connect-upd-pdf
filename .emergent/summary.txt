The AI engineer's trajectory showcases a systematic approach to evolving an application from an MVP state. Initial efforts focused on crucial UI fixes for the  and status display, followed by a significant backend refactor to unify PDF receipt generation, ensuring dual signature support, incentive display, and a refined A5 invoice-style layout. A major UI branding overhaul was then executed, integrating a new logo and a consistent Deep Blue/Bright Teal color scheme across the entire frontend. Subsequently, the engineer addressed a user request to prepare the app for public launch by implementing a targeted database cleanup endpoint that successfully cleared student-related data while preserving course information. The most recent work involved debugging two critical frontend issues: first, a non-functional agent profile photo upload, which was diagnosed and fixed by correctly linking the button to the file input; and currently, investigating why coordinators couldn't view agent-uploaded documents, leading to the discovery that the issue wasn't viewing, but rather agents' document upload fields being hidden.

The application's development began with a focus on UI improvements: rectifying a  visibility bug and ensuring Approve Student status displayed in high-contrast green. The next major requirement was to unify PDF receipt generation for both Admin and Coordinator roles into a single, consistent A5 invoice-style format. This unified PDF needed to display dual digital signatures, include course incentive amounts, and generate unique receipt numbers, resolving prior layout, alignment, and symbol display issues.

A comprehensive UI branding update was then requested, necessitating the replacement of the Annai Connect logo and a complete color scheme overhaul across the entire UI. This involved applying brand colors (Deep Blue: #1B5BA0, Bright Teal: #4ECDC4, Dark Blue: #164a87, Light Teal: #7FDBDB) to the login screen (gradient), header, buttons, form elements, and other interactive components, all while preserving existing functionality.

Recently, the user requested to clear all admitted student data for a fresh public launch, while explicitly preserving the course list. Following this, a bug was reported where agents were unable to upload profile photos, as the upload photo button was non-functional. The latest reported issue is that coordinators are unable to view documents uploaded by agents when clicking the eye icon in the student details view.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:


-   ****:
    -   *Summary of Importance*: This is the main React application component, integrating core UI elements like  and , managing state, API interactions, and UI rendering.
    -   *Summary of Changes*:
        -   Initial fixes for  visibility via CSS classes and approved status display logic.
        -   UI branding updates: login form logo (), header styling ( title), and widespread  component styling (e.g., ), and form element focus states to align with brand colors.
        -   **Agent Profile Photo Upload Fix**: Modified the agent profile section's photo upload mechanism (lines 990-1010). Initially, a  error was introduced and fixed; the final approach ensures the Upload Photo button directly triggers the hidden file input, resolving the non-functional button issue.
        -   **Document Viewing Investigation**: Analyzed for the Eye icon click handler (lines 840-860 and 1830-1860) and  display logic (lines 1950 onwards) to debug coordinator's inability to view documents.

-   ****:
    -   *Summary of Importance*: Contains global and component-specific styles, defining the application's visual appearance and layout.
    -   *Summary of Changes*: Extensive modifications for the comprehensive UI branding: incorporation of the new brand color palette (Deep Blue , Bright Teal , Dark Blue , Light Teal ), implementation of blue-to-teal gradient backgrounds for the login page and header, and application of brand colors to interactive elements such as primary buttons (, ), form focus states, user role badges, file upload buttons, loading spinners, and dialog headers.

-   ****:
    -   *Summary of Importance*: Serves as the FastAPI backend, managing API routes, database operations, and PDF generation.
    -   *Summary of Changes*:
        -   **Unified PDF Generation**: Implemented  to centralize PDF logic (reducing over 170 lines) and updated  and  to use it. Enhanced PDF content to include Coordinator/Admin signatures, course incentives, unique receipt numbering (e.g., ), and refined layout for A5 size with invoice-style presentation and correct Rupee symbol ().
        -   **Student Data Cleanup Endpoint**: Added a new, targeted API endpoint to clear student-related collections (, , , ) while preserving course data () and user records. This was a custom solution to the user's request for a fresh dashboard for launch, without affecting users.
        -   **Document Retrieval**: Endpoint  was examined during the document viewing bug investigation and found to be functionally correct.

-   ****:
    -   *Summary of Importance*: Acts as a comprehensive log for problem statements, testing data, protocols, and communication between the AI engineer and sub-agents.
    -   *Summary of Changes*: Continuously updated to document successful backend and frontend tests across all implemented features, including unified PDF functionality, UI branding updates, student data cleanup, and agent profile photo upload. It also logs the ongoing investigation and findings for the coordinator's document viewing issue, including observed UI states and backend API checks.

<pending_tasks>
The immediate pending task is to address the newly identified issue where agents' file upload inputs for documents are not visible (), preventing them from easily uploading documents. This was the root cause found for the previous coordinator unable to view documents bug report.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was investigating a user-reported bug: the documents uploaded by agents were unable to view by coordinator on clicking the eye icon.

The investigation process unfolded as follows:
1.  **Initial Diagnosis**: The engineer examined the frontend code in  for the Eye icon click handler, , and the  display section.
2.  **Backend Check**: The backend API endpoint  in  was checked and appeared functionally correct.
3.  **UI Observation (Coordinator)**: Screenshots taken as a coordinator initially showed No documents uploaded for a test student (Fresh Start). This led to an initial hypothesis of issues with the backend API, data structure, or access control.
4.  **Reproducing the Issue (Agent & Coordinator)**: To test the full flow, the engineer logged in as an agent, attempted to upload documents for the Fresh Start student, and then re-checked as a coordinator.
5.  **Key Insight and Root Cause Shift**: Backend testing revealed that the system was working correctly; the coordinator initially saw No documents uploaded because the student truly had no documents. After a document was manually uploaded (likely via a workaround or direct test), the coordinator *was* able to successfully view the TC document with Available status. This confirmed the coordinator viewing functionality itself was not the problem.
6.  **New Problem Identified**: The actual issue observed was that the agent dashboard's file upload inputs were , preventing agents from easily uploading documents. This implies that while the viewing mechanism is sound, the *upload* mechanism for agents is currently hindered, leading to a perceived no documents state from the coordinator's perspective.
