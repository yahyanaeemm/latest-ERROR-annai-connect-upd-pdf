The previous AI engineer successfully brought the educational admission system from MVP to a production-ready state, implementing core features like role-based authentication, student admissions, document uploads, and basic incentive tracking. Key enhancements included e-signatures, visual status indicators, dynamic course management, and a robust 3-tier approval system (Agent -> Coordinator -> Admin). A comprehensive automated backup system was also added, and Excel exports were improved. The focus then shifted to a major UI/UX overhaul and a leaderboard feature. While the backend for these new features was successfully implemented and tested, the modern frontend UI (specifically the  component and dark theme implementation) introduced critical JavaScript errors, preventing the application from loading correctly. The engineer identified the problematic component and is currently working on replacing it with a simpler, functional version while removing the dark theme as requested by the user.

The application streamlines student admissions for an educational institution, managing students, tracking agent incentives, verifying documents, and allowing data export. It supports three roles: Agent (submits forms, uploads documents, views status, tracks incentives), Admission Coordinator (reviews, approves/rejects, adds e-signature, submits for incentive approval), and Admin (full dashboard, reports, incentive payment management). Initial features included document storage, dynamic incentive rules, responsive UI with specific color branding (white, deep navy, gold). Subsequent enhancements focused on implementing a 3-tier student approval system, enabling admin-level e-signature management, and creating an automated data backup and restore mechanism. The latest set of requirements involves a Leaderboard Feature for agents (weekly, monthly, custom filters, top 3 highlighting), a comprehensive UI/UX modernization (2025 trends, dark/light mode, responsiveness), and ensuring admission overview numbers are accurate with agent incentives in Excel reports, and admin PDF receipt generation is available.

<current_work>
The system is currently recovering from a significant regression introduced by a modern UI/UX redesign and leaderboard feature implementation. While the backend for these features (leaderboard APIs, enhanced Excel export, admin PDF receipt generation) was successfully implemented and tested, the frontend integration led to critical JavaScript errors, preventing the application's UI from loading correctly and reverting it to a basic login form. The previous AI engineer identified the  component as the primary culprit.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer:
1.  Acknowledged the new bug report (unable to visualise on adding new students, course details and pdf reciept generation is still missing in admin console) and the user's request to remove the dark theme.
2.  Initiated fixes by systematically removing all  related code and references from  and .
3.  Temporarily removed the  component from  to isolate the issue.
4.  Confirmed that removing  allowed the basic system login form to load, indicating this component was indeed causing the JavaScript errors.
5.  Verified that the backend functionality (agent login, student list, leaderboard APIs) is still working correctly via  tests.
6.  The engineer's current action is to implement a simplified  to replace the problematic  component, aiming to restore full UI functionality without breaking the application again.
