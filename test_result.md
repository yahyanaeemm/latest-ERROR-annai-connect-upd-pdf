# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

Need to investigate if this is a frontend display issue or data synchronization problem. Backend testing shows leaderboard APIs working correctly and returning dynamic data from database."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Enhance the existing admission and agent incentive platform with 7 key functionalities: 1) E-Signature functionality for Admission Coordinator (digital pad + image upload), 2) Visual approval indicators with color-coding, 3) Receipt upload functionality fixes, 4) More course options with dynamic incentive management, 5) Admin incentive management UI, 6) Report export fixes with filters, 7) OTP-based login creation. Focusing on Phase 1 & 2 (features 1-6) first. Phase 3: Database-based manual verification system for new user registration instead of OTP emails - admin approval required for new agents/coordinators. NEW ENHANCEMENTS: Leaderboard system with overall/weekly/monthly rankings, enhanced admin dashboard with fixed admission overview, enhanced Excel export with agent incentive totals, admin PDF receipt generation."

Enhanced file upload wrapper with proper styling. 2) PDF SIGNATURE INTEGRATION: Updated both regular student receipts and admin-generated receipts to properly include admin signatures. Regular receipts now check for both coordinator signatures (from student approval) and admin signatures as fallback. Admin receipts include dedicated admin signature section. 3) SIGNATURE DISPLAY: Current signature properly displayed in dialog with metadata (type, date). 4) BACKEND IMPROVEMENTS: Enhanced signature fetching logic to include admin signatures in PDF generation with proper error handling.
